This directory contains the files needed to build Maproom dependencies.

To build dependencies, gattai is required. You can checkout the code from:

http://www.sf.net/p/gattai

After checking out the code, open a terminal and change to this directory.
From there, you can build the dependencies like so:

python /path/to/gattai.py maproom_recipe.json
