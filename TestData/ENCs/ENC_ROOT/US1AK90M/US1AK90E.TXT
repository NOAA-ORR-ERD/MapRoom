NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights Buoys and Fog 
Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
Aids to Navigation will be maintained seasonally 
from 1 July to 1 November.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - RADIO NAVIGATIONAL AIDS
Radio navigational aids on the Russian Arctic 
coast and adjacent islands north of the Arctic 
Circle have been omitted due to the lack 
of reliable information.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are advised that in the shallow waters of 
the Beaufort Sea, water levels are strongly 
influenced by meteorological conditions. Strong 
offshore winds can produce water depths up to 
0.8 meters (2.6 feet) less than those shown.


RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS are 
activated by radars operating on the X-Band 
frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHZ, and when 
activated will emit an international morse code 
character which will be visible on the radar screen 
that activated the RACON. The effective range 
of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 miles. 
The RACONS will be maintained seasonally 
from 1 July to 15 September.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUBSISTENCE WHALING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA
Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in 
subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15 
to October 31. Vessel operators are requested to contact 
the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission at (907) 852-2392, 
or aewcdir@barrow.com prior to entering this area for infor-
mation about the location and avoidance of traditional Native 
hunting parties.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are
required for fixed mineral development structures 
shown, subject to approval by the 
District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard 
(33 CFR 67).


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian Hydrographic Service.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE D
Maritime boundary provisionally applied pending formal exchange of 
instruments of ratification.
According to Article 3 of the Agreement Between the United States 
of America and Russia on the Maritime Boundary, signed June 1, 1990:
"1. In any area east of the maritime boundary that lies within 200 
nautical miles of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea 
of Russia is measured but beyond 200 nautical miles of the baselines 
from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the United States is mea-
sured ("eastern special area"), Russia agrees that henceforth the United 
States may exercise the sovereign rights and jurisdiction derived from 
exclusive economic zone jurisdiction that Russia would otherwise be en-
titled to exercise under international law in the absence of the agreement 
of the Parties on the maritime boundary...
3. to the extent that either Party exercises the sovereign rights or 
jurisdiction in the special area or areas on its side of the maritime boun-
dary as provided for in this Article, such exercise of sovereign rights or 
jurisdiction derives from the agreement of the Parties and does not 
constitute an extension of its exclusive economic zone. To this end, each 
Party shall take the necessary steps to ensure that any exercise on its 
part of such rights or jurisdiction in the special area or areas on its side 
of the maritime boundary shall be so characterized in its relevant laws, 
regulations, and charts."


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
