    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer shows seismic hazard in the United States.  The data
        represent a model showing the probability that ground motion will reach a
        certain level.  This map layer shows peak horizontal ground acceleration
        (the fastest measured change in speed, for a particle at ground level that
        is moving horizontally due to an earthquake) with a 10% probability of
        exceedance in 50 years.  Values are given in %g, where g is acceleration
        due to gravity, or 9.8 meters/second^2.  The lines of equal hazard, which

        are the lines between the polygons, were determined by interpolating from
        a grid of equally spaced points in latitude and longitude.  Each point was
        weighted based on the seismic hazard at that location.  The grid spacing
        is 0.1 degrees for Alaska and the conterminous United States, and 0.02
        degrees for Hawaii.
      Purpose:
        This map summarizes the quantitative information, available from geologic
        and geophysical sources, about seismic ground motion hazard in the United
        States.  The data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.

        No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or the National
        Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.

      Supplemental_Information:
        This map layer was prepared by combining spatially-smoothed historic
        seismicity information with information from fault-specific sources.  The
        acceleration values contoured are the random horizontal component.  The
        reference site condition is firm rock, defined as having an average shear-
        wave velocity of 760 meters/second in the top 30 meters corresponding to
        the boundary between National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP)
        site classes B and C.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Information drawn from the sources was used to produce an ASCII file
          of grid points having a latitude and longitude spacing of either 0.1
          degrees (conterminous United States and Alaska) or 0.02 degrees
          (Hawaii).  For each grid point an associated acceleration value, or
          weight, was calculated from the historic seismicity and fault-specific
          sources, according to the prescribed seismological model.  The data were
          then contoured using Arc/INFO.  The desired final lines of equal
          seismological hazard were selected and polygon and arc topology were
          ascertained as well as appropriate feature attributes.  The file was
          converted to Shapefile format.
