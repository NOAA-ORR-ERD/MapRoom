Notes on Getting MapRoom Up and Running on Win65 box:

 = 32 bit Python =
 
 I decided to punt on the 64 bit for now. See below for some notes form when I started to look at 64 bit.
 
  == C/C++ compiler ==

Visual Studio Express 2008: install it and it "just works"

 == Python and packages==
 
There is now a script:  `check_maproom_deps.py` that will try to import eveything, and give you a warnign if it its not there or the wrong version.

 
 Note: lots of great binary builds available from Chris Gohlke's site: 

 [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/]

I've used a lot of those.
 
 * python 2.7 from python.org
 
 * setuptools via `python ez_setup.py`
   NOTE: as of this writing, this installed version 0.6c11, which seems to work fine. However, there is a Windows binary out there that isntalls 0.6c12, that that version isntalls a binary for runnign scripts that opens up a new DOS box -- and makes things unworkable.

 * wxPython   2.8.12.1 unicode (from wxPython.org)
 
 * numpy 1.6.1 from numpy org (32 bit superpack)

 * pyopengl 3.0.1 (gohlke)
 
 * pyproj 1.9.0: (gohlke)
 
 * GDAL/OGR 1.9.0: (gohlke)
  
 * cython 0.15.1: (gohlke)
 
 * 

 == Extras ==
 (not needed by MapRoom, but...)
 
 * scipy 0.10.1 from scipy.org (32 bit superpack)

 * ipython 0.12 (gohlke)

 * nose 1.1.2 (gohlke) -- should be needed, but not yet!

 * PIL 1.1.7 (gohlke) 

 * py2exe 0.6.10dev (gohlke)
 
 * pyreadline 1.7.1 (gohlke)
 
 * Sphinx 1.1.2 (gohlke)
 
 * 
 
 == In house libs ==
 * pyTriangle 2.6.1: you'll find this in the "libs" part of teh maproom project. It's ours, but I kept it separate form maproom as it's useful on its own. It should build from source if you've got Cython and the C compiler set up right.
 
 == Accessories ==  
 
 Stuff I like to use:
 
 TortoiseSVN 

 Peppy (easy_install -U peppy)
 

 = 64 bit Python =

To build 64 bit extensions, I used the Window7 SDK:

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/confirmation.aspx?id=3138

as per instructions on the cyhton Wiki:

http://wiki.cython.org/64BitCythonExtensionsOnWindows



Python stuff installed:

python2.7 64 bit (python.org
wxPython 2.8.12 (wxPython.org)
setuptools (easy_setup.py)

GDAL binaries from:

(VS2008 builds, latest release: finished at 2012.02.29.)
